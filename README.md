# Android Project 2 - Wishlist

Submitted by: **Jose Valle**

**Wishlist** is a wishlist app that helps the user keep track of what they want to buy.

Time spent: **10** hours in total

## Required Features
The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can add an item to their wishlist (Name, Price, URL)
- [x] User can see their list of items based on previously inputted items (scrollable list)

## Optional / Stretch Features
- [ ] Wishlist app is ðŸŽ¨ **customized** ðŸŽ¨ (custom theme)
- [x] User can delete an item by long pressing on the item
- [x] User can open an item's URL by clicking on the item

## Additional Features
- [x] Input validation (name required, price must be a number, URL format checked)
- [x] URL normalization (adds `http://` if scheme missing)
- [x] Auto-scroll to newly added item
- [x] Clears inputs and hides keyboard after submit
- [x] Uses `MaterialCardView` row with `wrap_content` height to ensure items render correctly
- [x] Graceful error handling for invalid URLs (`ActivityNotFoundException`)

## Notes
- Ran into an AAPT error when building `item_wishlist.xml`â€”fixed by adding the `tools` XML namespace for `tools:text`.
- Initial `R` reference issue caused by wrong import / resource id mismatch; resolved by removing `import android.R` and using the correct layout/id names.
- Avoided constraining views across different parents (RecyclerView vs AppBar); simplified to a single `ConstraintLayout`.
